                <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I am a 32 year old husband. I have two dogs which are practically like children.After graduating from high school I worked endless jobs and I curerntly work in a small shipping and recieving department which has taught me how to work well with others. While I enjoy being physically active during work, I wanted to actually have a career that would support a family one day.</p>

                    <p>I got interested in software development when I have gotten heavily into the gaming world. I thought it would be cool to figure out how everything was made for production. When I was looking for programs for softeware development I found Thinkful and had talked to someone there multiple times before making my decision.</p>

                    <p>Now I'm a student at <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> and i'm very excited to start learning how to become a Software Engineer!</p>
